# Minecraft Server Compendium

Simple compendium application for sharing details about hosted Minecraft servers. It was created
primarily around sharing points-of-interest (coordinates) with friends and family that play together
on the same Minecraft server(s).

Built with Rails, Stimulus JS, and Tailwind CSS.
